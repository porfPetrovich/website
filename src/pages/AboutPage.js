        <Typography variant='h3'>Who is Porfiry Petrovich?</Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          Not me, or rather, that is not my name. I am Porfiry, author of this website, but the real, or rather, "real" Porfiry Petrovich, is my favourite character in my favourite novel. For those who do not recognize the reference, Porfiry Petrovich is the detective from Dostoevsky's <em>Crime and Punishment</em> who's wit and cunning are the prime instrument of psychological torment for the novel's protaganist, Raskolnikov. There are three reasons why I so love Petrovich:
          <ol>
            <li>From what us, the reader, can see, there is no point where Petrovich cannot see straight through Raskolnikov like a sheet of glass. He has the courage of convictions, which are backed up by clear thinking and complete immunity to bullshit, and all wrapped in a calm and cool demeanor, completely at ease with the way his investigation is going and the confidence in it's end state.</li>  
            <li>His methods, though they can seem cruel to the reader, are in fact at least somewhat compassionate, as they are focused on getting Raskolnikov to confess, and thus both easing his sentence and expaditing his path to rehabilitation.</li>  
            <li>As an appreciator of literature, the scenes in which Petrovich appears are amongst the most tense and gripping of the novel, and serve as a demonstration of linguistic mastercraft, even translated.</li>  
          </ol>

          Austrian Economics, Self-Sovereignty, Peer-to-Peer Systems, and the Human Condition

          Austrian Economics
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          The Austrian School of Economics is something of a bottom-up viewpoint of economics. In the fiat/keynesian system that has pervaded the globe, we have come to view 'the Economy' as a sort of massive blob who's state can be measured, and then changed effectively by policy choices from politcal actors. This view, I would argue, is among the chiefest sources of the Western World's problems today.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          The Austrian School begins from the idea that humans act. They engage in behaviors and make choices that they believe will improve their lot in life, and these behaviors and choices have effects on the behaviors and choices of those around them. These effects ripple through and reflect off of one another, and the resulting outcomes are what we commonly think of as <em>economic phenomena.</em>

          Self-Sovereignty
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          The fundamental political unit is the individual. I believe that the story of humanity's moral progress, from the time we started building societies to the present day, is essentially the gradual shifting of rights from the <em>group</em> down to the <em>individual.</em> In fact, I argue that there are no other rights at all; that to attempt to assign rights to groups is in fact a meaningless statement, a contradiction in terms.

          Individuals should have full sovereignty over their life, their liberty, and their property. The tools and techniques for individuals to fully realize their sovereignty are becoming more and more available in the age of the Internet.

          Peer to Peer Systems
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          A sizeable chunk of the backbone of the internet is concentrated in the hands of what is colloquially known as "Big Tech". These hyper-centralized systems distribute content through web browsers and mobile apps, and they barter this service for surveillance power. This system does not need to be the way the internet functions.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          When you send a message via Whatsapp or Facebook or even Signal, it passes through their servers before it gets to your intended recipient. That is a centralized system. In the modern age, there is <em>no reason</em> for this, in principal, except that these systems have something of a first mover advantage.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>Though infrastructure and functionality may be currently lacking, now that we have Bitcoin, the first monetary system that can function purely peer-to-peer, I believe the time has truly arrived for an assault against the centralized systems of the web in favour of peer-to-peer systems. Stay tuned for options.</Typography>

          Improving the Human Condition
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          The march of modernization has made unbelievable improvements in the basic conditions of humanity's existence. Imagine what your living condition would be without such conveniences as toilet paper, central heating, the tractor, fertilizers, antihistamines...
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          The human mind is an amazing thing, but as it dragged us from the medieval ages, throwing off the shackles of superstition and creation myths and launched us headlong into the scientific world, we are discovering more and more that our spiritual conditions have become fragile. To paraphrase Breedlove, there is the world of <em>matter</em> vs the world of <em>what matters</em>, and we have unwittingly let the latter fall by the wayside. It's now been 142 years since Nietzsche charged humanity with the killing of God, and he's not coming back.

          The average person spends <Link href='https://explodingtopics.com/blog/social-media-usage'>two and a half hours</Link> on social media, amounting to almost 16% of one's waking hours. <Link href='https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db491.htm'>Drug overdoses </Link> and <Link href='https://news.fiu.edu/2024/suicide-has-reached-epidemic-proportions-in-the-us-yet-medical-students-still-dont-receive-adequate-training-to-treat-suicidalpatients'>suicides</Link> continue to rise.

        <Typography variant='body1'>
          To put it frankly, every conceivable technological and economic improvement will be rendered moot if the mental illness of our age consumes us. We pursue fairness and freedom to improve the lot of <em>individual people</em>, but if those people turn from the world and lose themselves inwardly, embrace vice over virtue and allow their worst instincts to control them, then no good will have been done.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          Luckily, these things are all related. With freedom comes responsibility, with responsibility comes purpose, with purpose comes <em>meaning.</em> But that freedom must be taken, and it starts with making better, more long-term, more personal-sovereignty-focused decisions on how to live ones life.
