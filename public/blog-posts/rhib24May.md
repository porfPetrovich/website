## May 24
First in a series that I hope will continue. I plan on doing these sorta kinda weekly to bi-weekly.
### Wall Street Purchasing ETF Exposure
Several Major Wall Street Firms have purchased newly offered Bitcoin ETFs offered by Blackrock, Grayscale and others. Most of these purchases are likely on behalf of their clients. Morgan Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Investments, [wrote a blog post](https://experts.bitwiseinvestments.com/cio-memos/whos-buying-bitcoin-etfs-according-to-13f-filings) about professional investment firms purchasing them about a week ago. He goes through the 13f filings of the 11 publicly traded spot bitcoin ETFs and found that 563 professional investment firms reported owning 3.5 billion worth of bitcoin ETFs – but since, at the time of his writing, that Bitcoin ETFs had around 50 billion under management, that professional investors make up only about 7-10% of the total AUM for the ETFs, with the rest belonging to retail.

The eleven Bitcoin ETFs offered in the US are:

    • ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (NYSE:ARKB)
    • Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSE:BITB)
    • Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT)
    • Franklin Bitcoin ETF (NYSE:EZBC)
    • Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (NYSE:FBTC)
    • Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSE:GBTC)
    • Hashdex Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA:DEFI)
    • Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (NYSE:BTCO)
    • VanEck Bitcoin Trust (NYSE:HODL)
    • Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (NASDAQ:BRRR)
    • WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (NYSE:BTCW) 

The 13F is a quarterly report in the US that institutional investment managers are required to file is they hold over $100 million in assets under management. You can search those tickers symbols on [13f.info](https://13f.info/) and get a list of organizaitons

### Craig Fucking Wright

Craig Wright, scammer and grifter extraordinaire, has been back in courts in England, this time on the receiving end of a lawsuit that was filed by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance to stop him from claiming that he is Satoshi (utterly insane that it ever came to that). The judge gave [this statement](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/14/justice-james-mellors-ruling-on-craig-wright-copa-trial/)  in March :
> First, that Dr. Wright is not the author of the Bitcoin White Paper.
> Second, Dr. Wright is not the person who adopted or operated under the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" in the period 2008 to 2011.
> Third, Dr. Wright is not the person who created the Bitcoin System.
> And, fourth, he is not the author of the initial versions of the Bitcoin software.

The written judgment awaits, but is due out soon. After that, the court may seek perjury charges against him [(“lying extensively and repeatedly”, per Judge Mellor)](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/15/what-happens-next-in-copa-vs-craig-wright-trial-is-down-to-the-judge/)
The judgment can be read [here](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/COPA-v-Wright-judgment-250723-2.pdf).

For those who don’t recall, Wright also sued Hodlonaut for tweeting that he was not Satoshi Nakomoto, which predictably failed miserably. 
Basically the entire of the Crypto universe rejoiced in dunking on Wright this week, and even the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/21/business/bitcoin-satoshi-craig-steven-wright.html) couldn’t resist getting in on the action .
Essentially nobody believes anything he says, and I doubt even he does, since his whole project of frivolous lawsuits is essentially just a marketing campaign for his personal Shitcoin grift that is BSV.
And speaking of grifters…

### Trump declares he’s accepting Crypto
Donald Trump loves a bit of grift on his own (who can forget Trump University?). It’s easy to forget that the guy’s a pretty obvious conman because he gets a few things right about ‘woke’ and related topics, but if you need a reminder, he’s [run several business into the ground to boost his brand](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-05-18/trump-business-partners-outline-his-failed-deals) , and rug pulled God knows how many feces throwers by [getting in on the NFT scam train](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-trading-cards-nft-b2322583.html).

I don't know who needs to hear this, but politicians are not your friend.

### SAB 121 overturned
SAB 121 was an [SEC accounting rule](https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121) that effectively prevented banks from custodying crypto for their clients, as they would be forced to list it as a liability on their balance sheets (and therefore hold a commensurate level of cash on hand to cover it if the asset goes belly-up). This is abnormal; the standard practice for other assets, such as stocks or bonds, is that the assets held in custody by a bank or financial institution are not treated as a liability on the balance sheet of the custodian. This is because the assets are not owned by the custodian, but rather held in trust for the benefit of the client. The custodian's role is to safeguard the assets and facilitate transactions as directed by the client. 

Banks didn’t like this decision and a bank lobbying group – the American Bankers Association – [let Gary Gensler know](https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/joint-comments-to-sec-on-sab-121) back in February that they were not to be left out of the party (not your keys, not your coins applies to our financial overlords as well). The Senate [approved a resolution](https://financialregnews.com/senate-approves-resolution-overturning-secs-crypto-asset-rule/) overturning the rule. A whole bunch of Democrats decided to vote for the bill’s repeal, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Shumer, who, no surprises, receives the majority of his donations from Wall Street. Biden says he’s [going to veto](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SAP-HJRes109.pdf) the overturn, though.


### More Regulation Stuff: FIT21

The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st century act made it through the House on Wednesday. [Whole bill here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4763/text) for legal nerds.

It aims to provide a regulatory framework for Crypto ('crypto') in the United States, by letting the SEC (which manages securities) and the CFTC (which manages commodities) decide which would get to govern speficic kinds of crypto assets based on decentralization rules. Broadly speaking, the rule is that if no issuer or individual person has control of 20% or more of the difital asset or voting power of it, and no individual has authority to control the asset or its usage, then it's decentralized enough to be a commodity and goes to the CFTC. Otherwise, it's a security, and goes to the SEC.

This series will not be about shitcoinery, so I only touch on the passing of these bills to note that, predictably, Gary Gensler (recall, chair of the SEC) does not like that he's losing a slice of the pie. In a [blog post](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-21st-century-act-05222024), he laid out his case that the SEC has done a great job since it's inception of regulating financial markets and that the bill would remove some of that power, since crypto asset issuers can just declare themselves decentralized and the SEC only has 60 days to review their declaration - an implausibly small timeframe given there are 16000 crypto assets, the vast, vast majority of which are scams. 

But he points to the [Howey Test](https://investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp), which essentially defines a security, for practical purposes, as something that involves investment of money in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others. 

As I touch on below, there are certain bitcoiners who are in Bitcoin for fiat-denominated profits. But I would point out that, from the Austrian Economics, commodity-theory-of-money point of view, one is not investing *money* in Bitcoin or any other digital asset, they are investing *central bank credit*. Also, I'm not seeking profits, I'm hedging inflation risk (among other things). between December 1922 and November of 1923, bread in Germany [rose in price](https://www.johndclare.net/Weimar_hyperinflation.htm) from 163 marks to 201 billion marks.

There is an apocryphal story about hyperinflation in Weimar Germany: prices could snapshot so quickly and painfully that bar goers would purchase all the beer they were planning on drinking at the beginning of the night, since prices would shoot up by the hour. If one person sells one of his extra beers to his buddy midway through the night, has his beer just become a security by the Howey test?

Clearly that pint is not a 'common enterprise', but the point remains: we draw a distinction between denominating your savings in something non-debaseable and investing with the intention of profits in a debased currency.

### Yuval Harari’s Weird Statement on Bitcoin
Harari came under fire for his exceptional misunderstanding of the term ‘trust’ and how it relates to Bitcoin, which he delivered first in a podcast, and then [doubled down on in a video](https://x.com/harari_yuval/status/1792934757325553797) posted to X/Twitter. I won’t join the pile on, except to explain his misundestanding. Bitcoin is not a currency of *distrust*, it is a currency of *trustlessness*. It is a currency that does not necessitate trust in anyone to function. 

Consider two methods of instantaneous payments: Venmo and on-chain Bitcoin transactions. Both credit money from one party and debit that money to the other. The first kind of transaction requires the sender to trust their bank to still be able to deliver their funds, trust Venmo to mediate the transaction between the sending bank and receiving bank, and then trust the other party’s bank to debit the received funds to their inteded recipient's account. The Bitcoin transaction requires none of that trust in the intermediaries, because Bitcoin does not use intermediaries; it is peer-to-peer. Either of the two parties involved in the transaction could, in theory, have full trust in their banks or government. The trust (or lackthereof) is irrelevant to the actual payment itself with Bitcoin. Harari seems to extol this trust as a virtue, but it’s still not needed for Bitcoin to work.

To further illustrate the point, one can peruse the comments on basically any thread in r/Bitcoin, keeping your eye out for two sorts of posters and/or commentors: the ones who ask about when to cash out, taking profits, buying lambos, price action, etc; and those who discuss things like currency debasement, inflation, fed and/or commercial bank shenanigans, etc. The former category trust the banks and government. They are investing in Bitcoin to get exposure to its movements as an asset as it is denominated in Fiat Currency. The latter category do not trust the banks or government. They are rebasing their wealth in a system where that trust is not required. 

> “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.” 

-Satoshi Nakamoto
